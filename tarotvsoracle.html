      Tarot vs. Oracle Cards: What's the Difference?
      </h2>
        <p>
        One of the most common types of divination (or fortune-telling) - and also probably my personal favourite type - is card reading, or cartomancy if you want to use the fancy term. You don't need any specific kind of cards to perform cartomancy. In fact, card readings can be done with an ordinary deck of playing cards if you have the know-how. However, if your new to the prospect of divination it might be much easier for you to use a deck of cards that is designed specifically for this purpose and that's where Tarot and oracle cards come in.</p>
        <p>When buying your first deck of cards you may see all of these different terms stated on the boxes. Tarot card deck, oracle card deck. What's the difference? Is there a difference? Is there one that is better or easier for beginners? In this post I will answer these questions.</p>
      <h4>
        Tarot Cards
      </h4>
        <p>Tarot cards are ancient and traditional. Though more modern decks may add their own spin to the traditional format of Tarot - such as changing the names of the suits or replacing the names of some of the cards in the Major Arcana to sound more relatable to today's world - every deck of Tarot cards follows the same structure.</p>
        <p id="tarot">There are 76 cards in every Tarot deck, the first 22 being the Major Arcana. The Major Arcana represent 'major' occurences that take place in a person's life. The remaining 56 cards in the deck are the Minor Arcana which represent more day-to-day occurences and the structure is very similar to that of a normal playing card deck. There are four suits - wands, pentacles, cups, and swords - and within each of those four suits are cards numbered one (ace) to ten followed by four court cards; Page, Knight, King, and Queen.</p>
        <p>Tarot might be a bit challenging for the beginner to grasp. Every Tarot deck follows the same framework which means if you learn to read one Tarot deck you can read pretty much any, however that also means that if the meaning of the card isn't immediately obvious just from the picture and/or the title you need to memorize each of its potential meanings which may take some time to do for every single card. There are more beginner-friendly Tarot decks however. I would personally recommened any of the decks from Radleigh Valentine, as each card has several possible intreptations of its meaning written on and they all come with a in-depth guidebook which provides additional guidance, more reminiscent of an oracle deck.</p>
        <h4>Oracle Cards</h4>
        <p>As opposed to Tarot cards, oracle cards are much more freeform. No two decks of oracle cards are the same. There is no set number of cards that an oracle deck has to have or any structure it has to follow.</p>
        <p>Though there are some more advanced decks of oracle cards out there, I find oracle cards tend to be much easier for beginners to use than most Tarot cards. The cards will usually have a pretty self-explanatory title printed on them as well as possible intrepretations. More often than not they also come with guidebooks that provide additional insight for specific cards as well as instructions on how to use the cards overall.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>In my opinion oracle cards tend to be much easier for beginners to get the hang of. Personally I did actually start with Tarot myself (my very first deck and still one of my absolute favourites happens to be Fairy Tarot Cards by Radleigh Valentine) so if you personally feel drawn to working with Tarot instead however then there's no reason why you shouldn't. There are plenty of beginner-friendly Tarot decks out there, have a look around and read reviews!</p>
