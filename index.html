     My Top 5 Favourite Goddesses
      </h3></a>
        <p>
        A large part of Wicca is the inclusion of female deities. It's the belief that the Divine isn't only male and masculine, but a balance between both masculine and feminine energies is neccessary in the overall scheme of things. Whether you actually worship Goddesses, you choose to see them as Ascended Masters who are their to assist us on our personal journeys, or you don't neccessarily believe in them but see them simply as archetypes to aspire to when unleashing your own feminine power, any Wiccan practice can benefit from the inclusion of a Goddess or two. Here's a few of my personal favourites to work with.

      <h4>
      1. Diana</h4>
      <p>
          <strong>Diana</strong> (also known as <strong>Artemis</strong> in Greek mythology) is the Roman Goddess of the moon. As well as this she is also associated with the hunt (often being depicted with a bow and arrow) and nature; watching over wild animals in particular. She is known for looking after women, particurally young maidens. Because of this she is well-loved by women in particular, being the main deity worshipped in a specific female-exclusive type of Wicca known as Dianic Wicca.
