      My Top 5 Favourite Goddesses
          </h2></a>
        <p>
        A large part of Wicca is the inclusion of female deities. It's the belief that the Divine isn't only male and masculine, but a balance between both masculine and feminine energies is neccessary in the overall scheme of things. Whether you actually worship Goddesses, you choose to see them as Ascended Masters who are their to assist us on our personal journeys, or you don't neccessarily believe in them but see them simply as archetypes to aspire to when unleashing your own feminine power, any Wiccan practice can benefit from the inclusion of a Goddess or two. Here's a few of my personal favourites to work with.
        </p></br>
      <h4>
      1. Diana</h4>
      <p>
          <strong>Diana</strong> (also known as <strong>Artemis</strong> in Greek mythology) is the Roman Goddess of the moon. As well as this she is also associated with the hunt (often being depicted with a bow and arrow) and nature; watching over wild animals in particular. She is known for looking after women, particurally young maidens. Because of this she is well-loved by women in particular, being the main deity worshipped in a specific female-exclusive type of Wicca known as Dianic Wicca.

  Tarot vs. Oracle Cards: What's the Difference?</a>
      </h2>
        <p>
        One of the most common types of divination (or fortune-telling) - and also probably my personal favourite type - is card reading, or cartomancy if you want to use the fancy term. You don't need any specific kind of cards to perform cartomancy. In fact, card reading can be done with an ordinary deck of playing cards if you have the know-how. However, if your new to the prospect of divination it might be much easier for you to use a deck of cards that is designed specifically for this purpose and there's where Tarot and oracle cards come in.</p>
        <p>When buying your first deck of cards you may see all of these different terms stated on the boxes. Tarot card deck, oracle card deck. What's the difference? Is there a difference? Is there one that is better or easier for beginners? In this post I will answer these questions.</p>
      <h4>
        Tarot Cards
      </h4>
        <p>Tarot cards are ancient and traditional. Though more modern decks may add their own spin to the traditional format of Tarot - such as changing the names of the suits or replacing the names of some of the cards in the Major Arcana to sound more relatable to today's world - every deck of Tarot cards follows the same structure.</p>
