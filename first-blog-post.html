      <h2>
      My Top 5 Favourite Goddesses
      </h2>
        <p>
        A large part of Wicca is the inclusion of female deities. It's the belief that the Divine isn't only male and masculine, but a balance between both masculine and feminine energies is neccessary in the overall scheme of things. Whether you actually worship Goddesses, you choose to see them as Ascended Masters who are their to assist us on our personal journeys, or you don't neccessarily believe in them but see them simply as archetypes to aspire to when unleashing your own feminine power, any Wiccan practice can benefit from the inclusion of a Goddess or two. Here's a few of my personal favourites to work with.
        </p></br>
      <h4>
      1. Diana</h4>
      <p>
          <strong>Diana</strong> (also known as <strong>Artemis</strong> in Greek mythology) is the Roman Goddess of the moon. As well as this she is also associated with the hunt (often being depicted with a bow and arrow) and nature; watching over wild animals in particular. She is known for looking after women, particurally young maidens. Because of this she is well-loved by women in particular, being the main deity worshipped in a specific female-exclusive type of Wicca known as Dianic Wicca.
      </p>
      <h4>
      2. Kuan Yin</h4>
      <p>
          <strong>Kuan Yin</strong> (also spelt <strong>Quan Yin</strong>) is a Chinese Goddess that represents compassion for all living things; including human beings, animals, and nature. There is some debate about whether she was actually a woman who once lived in China but was elevated to 'Goddess status' after her death due to how loving and selfless she was. She is also associated with energy healing and Reiki.
      </p>
      <h4>
      3. Hecate</h4>
      <p>
     <strong>Hecate</strong> (also spelt <strong>Hekate</strong>) is a Greek Goddess of the moon, crossroads, and witchcraft. She is known as a 'way-shower', guiding people to the correct path to take in life when they are at a crossroads. She has many symbols such as a torches, keys, and a three-headed dog. She is known for teaching about many aspects of witchcraft such as the uses of magickal herbs. Despite being depicted as a virgin Goddess, she is also known for  watching over fertility and childbirth. 
      </p>
      <h4>
      4. Selene</h4>
      <p>
     <strong>Selene</strong> (also known as <strong>Luna</strong> in Roman mythology) is another Greek Goddess associated with the moon (Are you starting to notice a pattern here?). However unlike Hecate and Diana, she is regarded as being the personification of the moon itself. She is often depicted riding a chariot pulled by twin horses across the night sky.
      </p>
      <h4>
      5. Brigid</h4>
      <p>
          <strong>Brigid</strong> (known by many other names including <strong>Bride</strong>, <strong>Brigit</strong>, and <strong>Saint Brigid</strong>) is a Celtic triple Goddess associated with a wide variety of areas such as healing, childbirth, smithcraft, fire, and creativity (in particular, the writing of poetry). She is sometimes depicted as three sister Goddesses who all share the same name. The Pagan holiday Imbolc that takes place in February is dedicated to her and is also known as Brigid's Day. She was so well-loved by her people that she was even adopted into Christianty under the name Saint Brigid in an attempt to convince more Pagans to convert to Christanity.
