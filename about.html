      <p>I’m quite eclectic in my practice but mainly identity as a Green Wiccan and a Hedgewitch. I used to work at a small local magickal shop as a social media manager and shop assistant but I now hope to start my own business selling various magickal items.</p>
<p>I was drawn to witchcraft since I was a child and would watch or read literally anything I could get my hands on to do with witches and would make up my own ‘spells’. I grew up in a somewhat strict Christian household though and didn’t start seriously practicing the craft until I was about 20.</p>
<p>I mainly work with herbs, water, crystals, dreams, music and dance, meditation/visualisation and symbols/sigils in my practice.</p>
<p>I’m fascinated by virtually all types of divination but I’m most confident in tarot/oracle cards, runes, and automatic writing.</p>
<p>I love faeries, dragons, mermaids, unicorns, angels, and Goddesses.</p>
